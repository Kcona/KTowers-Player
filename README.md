# KTowers-Player
 Official Minecraft instance used for the players in the KTowers tournament

# How to install the instance
## No Premium
You need to create a profile for Fabric 1.20.4 and then just copy the ``mod`` folder from this repository to your Minecraft mod folder.

## Premium
We recommend you to use [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/download/). Prism Launcher is one of the most popular Minecraft instance managers, it is also open sourced and that is something good.

If you don't want to use Prism Launcher there is no problem you can do the same as **No Premium**.

If you use Prism Launcher you will have to download this instance as a zip by clicking on the green ``<> Code`` button, ``Download ZIP`` and then import it into your Prism Launcher. Then check the following things:
1. The Java version and path is correct.
2. Your Minecraft executes correctly and everything is working properly.
